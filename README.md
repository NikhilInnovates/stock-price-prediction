## Features
- **Historical Price Prediction**: Predicts future stock prices based on historical data.
- **Interactive Interface**: Easy-to-use Streamlit app for input and visualization.
- **Scalable Backend**: FastAPI backend for serving predictions.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses a Transformer-based model for accurate predictions.
- **Scaler Integration**: Scales input data for better model performance.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NikhilInnovates/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained model and scaler files:
   - Place `transformer_stock_model.pth` (model weights) and `scaler.save` (scaler file) in the project root directory.

---

## Usage

### Running the Backend (FastAPI)
1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8003`.

### Running the Frontend (Streamlit)
1. Start the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. The app will be available at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Making Predictions
1. Open the Streamlit app in your browser.
2. Enter historical stock prices (comma-separated) and the number of days to predict.
3. Click the **Predict** button to see the predicted stock price.

## Deployment

### Local Deployment
- Run the FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend locally as described in the [Usage](#usage) section.

### Cloud Deployment
- Use services like **Heroku**, **Render**, or **Google Cloud** to deploy the app.
- Example for Heroku:
  1. Create a `Procfile`:
     ```
     web: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
     ```
  2. Push your code to Heroku:
     ```bash
     heroku create
     git push heroku main
     ```
